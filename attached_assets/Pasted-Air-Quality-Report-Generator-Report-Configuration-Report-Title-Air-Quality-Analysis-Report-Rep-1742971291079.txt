Air Quality Analysis Report
Date: 2025-03-26

This report provides an analysis of air quality data collected from monitoring stations.

Executive Summary
This report analyzes air quality data collected over 8 days from 2025-02-06 to 2025-02-13.

Data was collected from 6 monitoring devices.

The average Air Quality Index (AQI) was 155.4, categorized as Unhealthy. This indicates air quality that is concerning, with potential health effects for the general population.

The maximum recorded AQI was 1793.8.

PM10 was the most problematic pollutant, exceeding recommended limits 60.4% of the time.

PM2.5 also showed elevated levels, exceeding limits 40.7% of the time.

Key Insights:

Data spans from 2025-02-06 to 2025-02-13

Recommendations
High Priority Actions
PM2.5 levels are increasing significantly. Consider implementing emission reduction strategies.
PM10 levels are increasing significantly. Consider implementing emission reduction strategies.
Average PM10 levels (113.0 µg/m³) exceed recommended limits. Consider dust suppression measures.
AQI levels are increasing significantly. Consider implementing emission reduction strategies.
Detected extreme PM2.5 spikes. Investigate potential emission sources or sensor malfunctions.
Detected extreme PM10 spikes. Investigate potential emission sources or sensor malfunctions.
Detected extreme AQI spikes. Investigate potential emission sources or sensor malfunctions.
Location monitored by device 524091 shows the highest pollution levels (AQI: 313.0). Prioritize interventions in this area.
Medium Priority Actions
Average PM2.5 levels (48.4 µg/m³) exceed healthy limits. Consider air filtration and reduced outdoor activities.
PM2.5 levels peak around 9 PM. Consider adjusting outdoor activities and ventilation schedules accordingly.
PM10 levels peak around 8 PM. Consider adjusting outdoor activities and ventilation schedules accordingly.
AQI levels peak around 9 PM. Consider adjusting outdoor activities and ventilation schedules accordingly.
